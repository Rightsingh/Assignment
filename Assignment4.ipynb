    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data and methods together within a class. It involves hiding the internal state and implementation details of an object and providing access to it through well-defined interfaces. Encapsulation helps in achieving data abstraction, data protection, and code modularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance allows the creation of new classes based on existing classes. It enables the reuse of code and the creation of a hierarchical class structure. A subclass (or derived class) can inherit attributes and behaviors from a superclass (or base class), and it can also add its own unique attributes and behaviors. Inheritance promotes code reusability and supports the concept of specialization and generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism means the ability of objects to take on multiple forms or have multiple behaviors. In Python, polymorphism is achieved through method overriding and method overloading. Method overriding allows a subclass to provide its own implementation of a method defined in the superclass. Method overloading allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated interchangeably if they share a common interface or base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction focuses on representing the essential features and behaviors of an object while hiding the unnecessary details. It allows the creation of abstract classes and interfaces that define a common structure or behavior for a group of related objects. Abstraction provides a level of indirection and helps in managing complexity by breaking down a system into smaller, more manageable parts. It allows developers to work with high-level concepts without worrying about the low-level implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "These four pillars of OOP (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction) provide a foundation for designing modular, reusable, and maintainable code by promoting code organization, flexibility, and code reuse."
